You have 3 teams (represented using the dictionaries) and the function adds members to the teams. Each member starts off with some number of points:
Youâ€™re using both *args and **kwargs in this function. 
When you call the function, you can first use any number of positional arguments (without a keyword) followed by any number of keyword arguments:

    The positional arguments are assigned to the tuple teams
    The keyword arguments are assigned to the dictionary people

Stephen, Kate, and Sharon are in both the red team and the blue team. Mary and Trevor are in the red and green teams. Ishaan is just in the blue team.

red_team = {"Stephen": 4}
blue_team = {}
green_team = {}

def add_team_members(*teams, **people):
    for person, points in people.items():
        for team in teams:
            if person not in team.keys():
                team[person] = points
            else:
                print(f"{person} is already in the team.")


#Stephen, Kate and Sharon are added to the red and blue teams
add_team_members(red_team, blue_team, Stephen=10, Kate=8, Sharon=12)

#Mary and Trevor are added to the red and green teams
add_team_members(red_team, green_team, Mary=3, Trevor=15)

#Ishaan is added to the blue team
add_team_members(blue_team, Ishaan=8)

print(f"{red_team = }")
print(f"{blue_team = }")
print(f"{green_team = }")

Stephen is already in the team
red_team = {'Stephen': 10, 'Kate': 8, 'Sharon': 12, 'Mary': 3, 'Trevor': 15}
blue_team = {'Stephen': 10, 'Kate': 8, 'Sharon': 12, 'Ishaan': 8}
green_team = {'Mary': 3, 'Trevor': 15}
